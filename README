This is a simple kernel module, designed to hang up the
kernel in various ways.

Why anyone would want to do that?
It is e.g. handy for testing systems monitoring software.
See the comments in the source on the various hang up methods
used.

To build it, simply execute ./build.sh.

Have a lot of fun...
